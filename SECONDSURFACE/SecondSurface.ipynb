    "\n",
    "* **Analysis:**\n",
    "    * The first sphere has a radius of 1, meaning all its points are exactly 1 unit away from the origin.\n",
    "    * The second sphere has a radius of √2 (approximately 1.41), meaning all its points are exactly √2 units away from the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conclusion:**\n",
    "    * Since the radii are different, there is no point that satisfies both equations simultaneously. In other words, no point can be both 1 unit and √2 units away from the origin.\n",
