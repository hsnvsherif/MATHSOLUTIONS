    "**Hello teacher, in this article, I wrote a short article about the Zeno paradox that has been bothering me since high school and I put it into a formula. I hope you don't have a heart attack while reading it. But in the end, the important thing is curiosity. This absurd hypothesis (an idea would be more accurate) belongs to me, but I got help from GPT in the technical aspect of the matter. Because it's been a while since I read a scientific article about Mathematics.End of the day this is not an article it is just a text**"
